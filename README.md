BMD Status Page Mod Themes Repo

## Submitting A Theme
You can sumbit your own theme by making a new folder under the `themes` directory.  
<br>
The name of the theme will be the folder's name.  
i.e The default theme is stored in `themes/default`
<br>
Your folder should include the following files:  
index.html  
```Required!```  
style.css  
```If you're styling the page in index.html you can leave this file empty, but it will be required.```  
bmd.ico  
```If you do not plan to change the icon of the tab, you can copy paste the `bmd.ico` file in the `default` theme.
It is part of the required files.```
